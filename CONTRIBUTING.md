## Development Workflow

1. Fork the repository and create a branch from `main`.
2. Keep changes focused and small.
3. Add or update tests when behavior changes.
4. Run local quality checks before opening a PR.
5. Open a pull request with a clear summary and test notes.

## Commit and PR Guidelines

- Use clear commit messages.
- Describe the problem, solution, and validation in the PR description.
- Link related issues when possible.

## Code Quality

- Prefer readable and maintainable code over clever shortcuts.
- Avoid breaking public behavior without documenting it in the README.
- Keep secrets and credentials out of commits.
